# Big O Notation

## what is time complexity?
time complexity tells us how the running time of an algorithm grows as input size increases.

## O(1)- Constant time 
the operation takes the same time regardless of input size.

example:
Accessing an element in a list by index.

## O(n)-Linear time
the time grows proportionally with input size.

example:
looping through a list to calculate sum.

## O(n<sup>2</sup>)- Qadratic time
time grows as square of input size .

example:
nested loops comparing each element with every other element.
