## 1. DSA mistakes I repeatedly make

1. I try to directly write code without first undersatnding the problem in plain english.
2. I expect logic to come instantly even for problems I have never seen before .
3. I confuse checking existence of an element with checking its frequency.
4. I forgot to consider edge cases like extra elements or mismatched lengths.
5. I rely on memorizing solutions instead of understanding why the logic works.


## 2. Python concepts I improved 

1. Using dictionaries to store frequency of elements .
2. Understanding how `.get (key,default)` works in dictionaries.
3. Writing clean functions with meaningful variable names.
4. Uisng conditional logic correctly inside loops.
5. Understanding time and space trade - offs while writing python code.


## 3. Topic that still feels weak 
I still struggle with independently identifying the correct approach for new DSA problems , especially deciding when to use hashing, two pointers , or counters without guidance.
