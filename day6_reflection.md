## HARDEST CONCEPT TODAY
The most challenging part today was understanding how hashing works internally , especially how dictionaries allow constant-time lookups and how that logic replaces nested loops in problems like frequency counting and the two-sum problem.

## What improved compared to Day5
Compared to day 5 , my understanding of traversal logic improved significantly .I am now more comfortable  iterating through arrays and using conditional checks to guide decisions, particularly in searching algorithms like linear search and binary search.

## One thing to fix tomorrow
I need to improve my ability to write code independently without relying on reference patterns , especially when designing loop ranges and boundary conditions . I will Focus on dry running logic on paper before writing code.
