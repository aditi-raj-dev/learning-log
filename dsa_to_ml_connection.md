# DSA to ML connection

## How arrays are used in ML datasets 
In machine learning , datasets are stored as arrays or matrices where rows represent samples and coloumns represent features .

## Why hashing is important in feature encoding
Hashing enables efficient encoding of categorical data and fast lookup during preprocessing .

## Example where DSA  causes slow ML systems 
Using inefficient data structures can drastically slow down ML preprocessing and training on large datasets.

## Why time complexity matters when data is large 
Efficient algorithm are essential to handle large-scale ML data and ensure scalability.
