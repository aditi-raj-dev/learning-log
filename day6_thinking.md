## Why hashing improves time complexity
Because it allows direct access in O(1) time using keys, eliminate nested loops.

## When binary search fails.
Binary search fails when the array is unsorted or when boundaries are not updated correctly or when their is wrong mid value calcuation.

## One mistake I made today
Was struggling to traverse arrays correctly while implementing hashing logic.
