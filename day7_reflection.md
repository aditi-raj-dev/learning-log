## One thing that clicked today
I understood how frequency - based logic works in problems in problems like anagram checking and array intersection , why checking counts is important instead of just checking existence .

## One thing that confused me
I still find it difficult to independently decide the best approach for new DSA problem without guided thinking.

## One improvement for next week 
I will focus on understanding problem- solving approaches first in plain English before writing any code.
