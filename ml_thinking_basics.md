## What is data?
Data is raw information collected from real world. It can be numbers , text , images, or records that by themselves do not give meaning , but when analyzed, help us find patterns or make decisions.

## What is a feature ?
A feature is an individual measurable property of data that is used by a machine learning model to learn patterns. Features are selected parts of data that are relevant for making predictions.

## Rule-based system vs Machine learning system
In a rule - based system, humans manually define rule and the system follows those rule exactly . Such systems fail when rules become too complex.
In a machine learning system , the system learns patterns automatically from data instead of using manually written rules. ML systems improve as more data is provided.

## Real - life Machine learning example: Spam Detection
In spam detection , a machine learning model is trained on thousands of emails labeled as spam or not spam. The model learns patterns such as certain keywords , sender behavior , email structure. Based on these learned patterns it can classify new incoming emails as spam or genuine.
