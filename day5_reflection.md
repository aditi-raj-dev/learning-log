# Reflection 

## what was hardest?
Building logic independently was the hardest part, especially without relying on predefined patterns .

## Where did you struggle logically?
I struggled with problems involving traversal of arrays and strings, particularly understanding how loops move through elemnts step by step.

## What did you improve today?
I improved my ability to write basic logic and code on my own and gained better clarity on how traversal works in arrays and strings.
